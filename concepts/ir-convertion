The convertion to ir involves transformation of higher level constructs for parsing to low level if, while and so on

possible solution about variables and accessors, every unit may have variable and store it's value into that variable. 
Then the variable may be eliminated if unused
group:
    on the beginning of this element put variable represent value of group.
    if group does having method call, then the method call is put at the end. In parameter it having the variable put on beginning.
    
    the ir data of group is put into it's value, not into global place and will be analyzed later

character sequence:
    just converted to match one of symbols in sequence
    if no qualifier, exit on not match
    if qualifier is '?', increase position counter on success
    if the qualifier is '+', use while loop. create variable "bool is_first = true" and at the end assign false.
        then check if that variable is true then return, else increase position counter and assign content to variable if needed
    if the qualifier is '*', use only while loop and increase position counter on each success
